# Data Files to Accompany “U.S. Import and Export Elasticities: A Panel Data Approach”

These are the generated files from the procedure described in my paper in [Empirical Economics, *2012*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-011-0456-1).

There are import data files and export data files.  If you click on the relevant folder, there will be another readme file describing the files therein.
